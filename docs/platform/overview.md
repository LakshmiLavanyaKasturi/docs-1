title: Hiro Platform Overview

## Introduction

The [Hiro Platform](https://platform.hiro.so/) is a cloud-based "sandbox" environment that enables you create, build and deploy a contract in less than 5 minutes. The Hiro platform already contains the tools and resources you need to create smart contracts.

## Hiro Platform design and architecture

The Hiro Platform was designed to make it easy to deploy contracts in a secure, cloud-based testing environment without placing many requirements on how you choose to use the Platform. When granted access to the Platform (via the sign-in process), only you have access to your own testing environment. No limitations or restrictions are placed on how many contracts you can work with or deploy, and Hiro will not require you to perform any additional installation or configuration steps to deploy contracts.

The Hiro Platform comes pre-installed with the following developer tools and resources to help speed up the deployment process:

- VSCode
- Git
- Clarity

These tools enable you to quickly get up and running with the Platform without requiring additional steps. Less setup time equals more time for development and testing.
