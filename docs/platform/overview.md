## Introduction

The [Hiro Platform](https://platform.hiro.so/) is a cloud-based development environment that enables you to create, build and deploy a Clarity smart contract in less than 5 minutes. The Hiro platform already contains the developer tools and resources to develop smart contracts.

## Hiro Platform design and architecture

We want to encourage developers to focus on shipping their business models to Stacks blockchain, ship often and happily, and avoid getting caught up with unboxing and infrastructure overhead.

To deliver that developer productivity, the Hiro Platform comes pre-installed with the following developer tools and resources to help speed up the developer journey:

- Web-based VS Code
- Clarinet
- Clarity for VS Code
- Git
- Git
- Clarity

These tools enable you to quickly get up and running with the Platform without requiring additional steps. Less setup time equals more time for development and testing.
