## Introduction

The [Hiro Platform](https://platform.hiro.so/) is a cloud-based development environment that enables you to create, build and deploy a Clarity smart contract in less than 5 minutes. The Hiro platform already contains the developer tools and resources to develop smart contracts.

## Hiro Platform design and architecture

The Hiro Platform was designed to make it easy to deploy contracts in a secure, cloud-based testing environment without placing many requirements on how you choose to use the Platform. When granted access to the Platform (via the sign-in process), only you have access to your own testing environment. No limitations or restrictions are placed on how many contracts you can work with or deploy, and Hiro will not require you to perform any additional installation or configuration steps to deploy contracts.

To deliver that developer productivity, the Hiro Platform comes pre-installed with the following developer tools and resources to help speed up the developer journey:

- Web-based VS Code
- Clarinet
- Clarity for VS Code
- Git
- Git
- Clarity

These tools enable you to quickly get up and running with the Platform without requiring additional steps. Less setup time equals more time for development and testing.
