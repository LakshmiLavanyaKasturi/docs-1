The [Hiro Platform](https://platform.hiro.so/) is a cloud-based development environment that enables you to create, build and deploy a Clarity smart contract. The Hiro platform already contains the developer tools and resources to develop smart contracts.

## Hiro Platform design and architecture

We want to encourage developers to focus on shipping their business models to Stacks blockchain, ship often and happily, and avoid getting caught up with unboxing and infrastructure overhead.

To deliver that developer productivity, the Hiro Platform comes pre-installed with the following developer tools and resources to help speed up the developer journey:

- VS Code in Web Browser
- Clarinet
- Clarity for VS Code
- Git

These tools enable you to quickly get up and running with the Platform without requiring additional steps. Less setup time equals more time for translating your business models into code, testing them, and deploying them to a Stacks network!
