## Create and build contracts

Once you create or import a project, you can view the existing contracts in your projects and edit them using the VS Code editor available in the Hiro Platform. You can [create new contracts](how-to-guides/how-to-create-contract.md) by referring to the [contract examples](feature-guides/contract-examples.md) and editing them using the Hiro Platform.
