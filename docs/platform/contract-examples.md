Contracts are programs stored on the Stacks blockchain, run when a specific set of conditions are met. Although a contract may be used in several different ways, typically, a smart contract is written by a developer to automate a specific process or workflow and keep a record of the transaction on a ledger so others can trust the transaction is genuine and authentic.

The [Hiro platform](https://platform.hiro.so/) enables you to write and deploy a smart contract using [Clarity](https://clarity-lang.org/), a programming language developed specifically for smart contracts. 

:::note

Hiro offers a [collection of Clarity smart contracts](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarity-examples/tree/main/examples) available for you to quickly extend and deploy the customized contracts.

:::

Now that you understand smart contracts, you can now [create](build-contract.md) and [deploy](deploy-project.md) your contracts using [Hiro platform](https://platform.hiro.so/).
