title: Contract Examples
---

## Introduction

The [Hiro platform](https://platform.hiro.so/) enables you to write and deploy a smart contract using [Clarity](https://clarity-lang.org/), a programming language developed specifically for smart contracts.

This feature guide helps you with a collection of Clarity smart contracts to quickly customize and deploy onto the Stacks blockchain.

## Examples

The following [Clarity examples](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarity-examples) helps you with a collection of Clarity smart contracts to easily interact with the Stacks blockchain.


| Clarity Example                                     | Description                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [hello-world](/examples/hello-world/)               | A beginner smart contract with examples of commonly used Clarity expressions and data structures                                          |
| [blank-project](/examples/blank-project)            | A blank project conforms to [Clarinet-compliant](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/how-to-guides/how-to-create-new-project) project structure |
| [counter](/examples/counter/)                       | Demonstrates how to use and interact with "variables" in Clarity by incrementing a 32-bit unsigned integer                                |
| [clarity-bitcoin](/examples/clarity-bitcoin/)       | Demonstrates how to parse Bitcoin transactions and block headers, and to verify Bitcoin transactions                                      |
| [fungible-token](/examples/fungible-token/)         | Demonstrates a basic fungible token that conforms to the SIP-010 FT standard                                                              |
| [non-fungible-token](/examples/non-fungible-token/) | Demonstrates a basic NFT collection that conforms to the SIP-009 NFT standard                                                             |
| [nft-marketplace](/examples/nft-marketplace/)       | Demonstrates a minimalistic NFT marketplace that allows users to list NFT for sale                                                        |
| [lightning-swaps](/examples/lightning-swaps/)       | Demonstrates LNSwap's submarine swaps between Stacks and Bitcoin                                                                          |
| [ordyswap](/examples/ordyswap/)                     | Demonstrates trustless atomic swaps between Ordinals and Stacks                                                                           |


The [Hiro platform](https://platform.hiro.so) allows developers to use the above smart contracts and quickly deploy them to the mainnet and testnet environments.

Now that you have Clarity smart contract examples, you can now [create](build-contract.md) and [deploy](deploy-project.md) your contracts using [Hiro platform](https://platform.hiro.so/).
