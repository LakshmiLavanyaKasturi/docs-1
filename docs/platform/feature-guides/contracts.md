## Introduction

Smart contracts are programs stored on the Stacks blockchain, run when a specific set of conditions are met. Although a contract may be used in several different ways, typically, a smart contract is written by a developer to automate a specific process or workflow and keep a record of the transaction on a ledger so others can trust the transaction is genuine and authentic.

The Hiro platform enables you to write and deploy a smart contract using [Clarity](https://clarity-lang.org/), a programming language developed specifically for smart contracts, in less than 5 minutes.

These pages presume you already understand a smart contract and how it is used in Bitcoin.

Now that you understand smart contracts, you can now [create](../how-to-guides/how-to-create-project.md) and [deploy](../how-to-guides/how-to-deploy-contract.md) your contracts using [Hiro platform](https://platform.hiro.so/).
