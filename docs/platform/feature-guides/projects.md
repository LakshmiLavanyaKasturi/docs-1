## Introduction

In the Hiro platform, projects are used to manage contracts. Since the platform already comes pre-packaged with Clarinet, there are no additional steps you need to perform to set up projects; they are already available to you. 

After signing into the Hiro platform with your credentials and accepting the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy, you will first be directed to the Welcome page and then the Projects page. The Projects page is where you can import any existing projects you have created from your GitHub repository or create new projects using examples provided by Hiro.
