Before creating your project, make sure to install and build Clarinet by referring to [how-to install and build Clarinet](how-to-guides/how-to-install-clarinet.md).

Now that you have installed and built Clarinet, you can [create a new project](how-to-guides/how-to-create-new-project.md), [add a new contract](how-to-guides/how-to-add-contract.md) and then populate the project with smart contracts.

Clarinet also provides tools for interacting with your contracts in a Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop (REPL) console, and perform automated [testing of contracts](how-to-guides/how-to-test-contract.md).

## Setup shell completions

Clarinet already has many different commands built in, therefore, you may find it useful to enable tab-completion in your shell. 
You can use `clarinet` to generate the shell completion scripts for many common shells using the command shown below.

```sh
clarinet completions (bash|elvish|fish|powershell|zsh)
```

After generating the file, you can refer to the documentation for your shell to determine where this file should be moved to, and what other steps may be necessary to enable tab-completion for `clarinet`.
