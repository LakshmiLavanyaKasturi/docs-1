## What is Clarinet?

Clarinet is a Clarity runtime packaged as a command line tool, designed to facilitate smart contract understanding, development, testing and deployment. Clarinet consists of a Clarity REPL and a testing harness, which, when used together allow you to rapidly develop and test a Clarity smart contract, with the need to deploy the contract to a local devnet or testnet.

To better understand Clarinet and how to develop with Clarinet, Hiro has created an introductory video tutorial series, from Hiro Engineer [Ludo Galabru](https://twitter.com/ludovic?lang=en), that will guide you through some of the basics and fundamentals of using Clarinet. The video also includes how you can use Clarinet to develop, test, and deploy smart contracts.
