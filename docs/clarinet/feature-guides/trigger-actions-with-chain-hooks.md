Title : Trigger actions with Chain Hooks
---

Chainhooks make the process of reacting to blockchain events easier and more reliable with a dedicated open source library for dealing with chains that can fork.
Chainhooks are used to trigger actions, based on the predicates that developers can write. 

Predicates can be any of the following:

- Certain amount of SIP-10 tokens were transferred.
- Particular address received some tokens on the Stacks blockchain.
- Particular print event was emitted by a contract.
- Particular contract was involved in a transaction.
- Quantity of BTC was received on a Bitcoin address.
- POX transfer occurred on the Bitcoin chain.
